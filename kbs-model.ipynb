    "-------------------------------------------------\n",
    "This expert system is designed to assess the risk of cervical cancer based on user-reported symptoms and risk factors. \n",
    "It uses a rule-based approach to provide recommendations ranging from urgent medical attention to general preventive care.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "- Users input symptoms and risk factors.\n",
    "- The inference engine applies medical knowledge-based rules.\n",
    "- The system provides feedback, including risk assessment, preventive measures, and guidance on seeking medical care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Matters:\n",
    "- Early detection of cervical cancer significantly improves treatment outcomes.\n",
    "- Encourages preventive measures such as HPV vaccination and regular screening.\n",
    "- Raises awareness and provides accessible health recommendations.\n",
