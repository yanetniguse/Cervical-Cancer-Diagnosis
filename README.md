# 🧬 Cervical Cancer Diagnosis System

Welcome to the **Cervical Cancer Diagnosis System** — a smart, web-based health assistant that leverages knowledge-based systems to detect symptoms of cervical cancer and recommend timely action.

This project is a demonstration of my **technical abilities**, **human-centered design thinking**, and passion for **solving real-world health challenges** using **software engineering** — particularly for underserved communities.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable yet deadly cancers affecting women, especially in **developing regions** where access to healthcare professionals and early screening is limited. Many women suffer in silence due to:
- Lack of medical knowledge and awareness  
- Cultural stigma and delayed checkups  
- Shortage of gynecologists in rural areas  
- Financial or logistical barriers to medical testing

---

## 💡 My Solution

I designed and built a lightweight **Cervical Cancer Diagnosis System** that:
- ✅ Works locally with minimal internet access  
- ✅ Provides a rule-based, explainable decision-making tool  
- ✅ Educates users with health tips, urgency levels, and action points  
- ✅ Can be easily integrated into rural health centers or awareness campaigns  
- ✅ Is extendable to cover other gynecological or infectious diseases

This was developed using **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and basic **AI rule-based logic** principles.

## 🔍 Use Case Scenario

Imagine a rural clinic or a mobile health van equipped with this system. A nurse or health volunteer can input symptoms reported by a woman, and in seconds:
- Get an analysis with the likelihood of cervical cancer
- Advise the patient on urgency levels (mild/moderate/severe)
- Provide actionable next steps

This kind of tool empowers frontline workers and educates women before it’s too late.
